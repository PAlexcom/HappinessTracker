About
-----
Happiness Tracker is an Android application totally based on positive psychology that allows you to track your daily happiness.
The application asks you: "How do you feel?" a fixed number of times during the day, keeps track
and calculate your average happiness during the Day, last Week (last 7 days) and last Month (last 30 days).
During the day the application shows you randomly some quick/short motivational and positive quotes or phrases.
Furthermore once a day it asks you to write one thing that you are grateful for.

The science behind
------------------
Happiness Tracker is a totally positive application based on the science of positive psychology.
The primary color used is Yellow since it is a warm color and it seems to be the color of happiness across the majority cultures.
The random quotes and phrases shown during the day are based on the labeling principle, which means that people tend to act as described in the label phrase and
believe the statement if said or frequently repeated. The one thing a day your are grateful of is based on the gratitude principle, that have been proved to
be a good technique to increase your happiness. __To prove each statement and for more information please look at the references section.__
