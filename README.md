Project created during my Master's Degree in Computer Science for the
_Mobile and Wireless Systems_ class.

About
-----
Happiness Tracker is a mobile application that allows
you to track and increase your daily happiness. The application
is totally based on the emerging science of positive psychology.
Therefore the application will always communicate in
a positive way directly and indirectly both via words or visually
(e.g. ”I will never attend an anti-war rally; if you have a
peace rally, invite me” Mother Teresa). More precisely the application
bases its functionalities on the theory of labeling and
gratitude. Practically speaking the application asks you a fixed
number of times during the day: ”How do you feel?”, once a
day it asks you to write something you are grateful for and fi-
nally randomly during the day it shows you some motivational
and labeling phrases via notifications.
